This is the implementation of Convolutonal Neural Network without using any neural
network creation libraries.

Libraries Used: numpy: 1.24.2, pandas: 1.5.3, PIL: 9.4.0, requests: 2.28.1, matplotlib: 3.6.3, os (no version specified), time (no version specified), random (no version specified)

Assumptions:
  1. Python 3.9.6 installed
  2. IDE installed (VS Code is recommended)
  3. Pip 23.0.1 installed

To Run Code:
  1. Navigate to file in IDE after downloading
  2. Install the necessary libraries
  3. Make sure you are in the right directory. Change directory by typing cd then the directory name 
  4. Create a directory in that directory to hold the images(images will automatically downloaded and saved to this folder)
  5. Go to "Link for labels of dataset" and download train.csv
  6. Move train.csv into correct directory
  7. Copy path of directory to hold images and train.csv and replace it with the environment variables "PHOTO_DIRECTORY_PATH" and "labelsCSV". These are found above main.
  8. Uncomment code at the various functions below the comparison class to run the function and see the charts. There is already a template provided. You can change the variables too for each function. They are the global variables in all caps above main below the section "#### CHANGE THESE FOR THE COMPARISON CLASS ####
". 
  9. Type python project.py to run code after you have uncommented the desired function and changed the variable
